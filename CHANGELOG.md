# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Windows desktop application** - Added a portable native desktop shell with one-click proxy and recording controls, HTTPS certificate installation, settings, live backend logs, and heartbeat status.
- **Model website profiles** - Added configurable capture profiles for ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, DeepSeek, Kimi, Qwen, Doubao, and Zhipu web applications.
- **Relay API recognition** - Added hostname-independent detection for versioned OpenAI-compatible endpoints and JSON request bodies containing model input.
- **Codex Responses API stream support** - Added reconstruction of `response.*` SSE events, preserving completed response output and rebuilding `response.output_text.delta` text when an upstream relay omits the final object.
- **Proxy uptime visibility** - Added an independent proxy running state and uptime indicator to the desktop live panel.

### Changed

- **Non-model traffic pass-through** - Large downloads, range responses, and media content that do not match a model request are streamed without buffering or recording; live proxy summaries now focus on captured model traffic.
- **Bounded pass-through activity logs** - Non-model activity is now rate-limited per host and displayed without URL paths or query parameters. The desktop live panel also preserves its collapsed state between launches.

### Fixed

- **Empty Codex response captures** - Responses API streams are no longer incorrectly handled as Anthropic streams, so Codex output is available in saved session response files.

## [2.9.5] - 2026-07-29

### Fixed

- **Excessive spacing in request list (recurrence)** - Measured request heights are no longer reset when exchange details are lazily merged into the session, which previously caused items to fall back to the estimated row height and re-introduce large gaps between requests (#89)


## [2.9.4] - 2026-07-28

### Fixed

- **Excessive spacing in request list** - Requests list no longer reserves unused vertical space between items; the actual measured height is used instead of clamping to the estimated row height (#87)


## [2.9.3] - 2026-06-02

### Changed

- Updated package version for the next release.
- Updated release changelog.

## [2.9.2] - 2026-04-26

## [2.9.1] - 2026-04-17

### Fixed

## [2.9.0] - 2026-04-15

### Added

- **Lazy-load session exchanges** - Session overview now loads exchange data on demand, significantly improving initial load time for sessions with many requests
